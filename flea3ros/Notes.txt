FLEA 3 - to ROS
===============

This package converts the FLEA3 GigE camera into a ROS topic.
The names of the topics will be: /SENSORS/FLEA3/#OFCAMERA.
The topic will publish at the highest resolution rate of the camera with the highest possible frequency.

This code seperates each camera to a seperated thread.

To run this code you must first install the flycapture api which is included in this package under installations.
You may also look at the data sheet of the camera.

Once you installed the flycapture API and perform a catkin_make to your workspace you can run this package by

rosrun flea3ros flea3ros
