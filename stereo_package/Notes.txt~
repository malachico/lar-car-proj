--The Perception Package--

-Updated 25 Jun 2014

Implemented Features:
1. Build a height map from the data that arrives from the IBEO, SICK and FLEA sensors.
2. Publish a map and a mini-map with obstacle information and road types.
3. Provide a visualization tool for everything

Features that work correctly:
1. The basic height map and mini-map is published with obstacle information.
2. The visualization tool can be used (see below how to use).

Problems and unimplemented things:
1. Stereo vision is not used for mapping due to the poor performance of the stereo matching algorithm, until a new algorithm is found.


How to use visualization tool:
Once the framework is running, open a terminal and enter this:

    rostopic pub /PER/VISUAL std_msgs/Bool "data: true" 

And two windows will pop open. The smaller window is the heightmap which is sent on the /MAP topic.
The large window is the terrain types window for the /MAP topic. Pink color represents unexplored area, 
black is obstacles and green is passable terrain. The thresholding slope angle chosen is arctan(0.1)
